#Step-1
Python Hand Gesture Recognition
At this point, your code should be able to get input from the camera and display it on the screen as if it were a mirror. It should also draw a rectangle where the user should put their hand.
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Hold the background frame for background subtraction.
background = None
# Hold the hand's data so all its details are in one place.
hand = None
# Variables to count how many frames have passed and to set the size of the window.
frames_elapsed = 0
FRAME_HEIGHT = 200
FRAME_WIDTH = 300
# Humans come in a ton of beautiful shades and colors.
# Try editing these if your program has trouble recognizing your skin tone.
CALIBRATION_TIME = 30
BG_WEIGHT = 0.5
OBJ_THRESHOLD = 18

Getting input from the camera and call functions to understand it
# Our region of interest will be the top right part of the frame.
region_top = 0
region_bottom = int(2 * FRAME_HEIGHT / 3)
region_left = int(FRAME_WIDTH / 2)
region_right = FRAME_WIDTH

frames_elapsed = 0

capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while (True):
    # Store the frame from the video capture and resize it to the window size.
    ret, frame = capture.read()
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, (FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT))
    # Flip the frame over the vertical axis so that it works like a mirror, which is more intuitive to the user.
    frame = cv2.flip(frame, 1)
    
    # Show the previously captured frame.
    cv2.imshow("Camera Input", frame)
    frames_elapsed += 1
    # Check if user wants to exit.
    if (cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('x')):
        break

# When we exit the loop, we have to stop the capture too.
capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
